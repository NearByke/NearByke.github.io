The competition is organized by Paris&Co and will require us to pitch our start-up in front of a jury in Paris on the 11th of December. The day after, the award ceremony will take place where the winner will receive 12,000 euro, while the second and third-placed teams will receive 8,000 and 3,000 euro respectively. On top of that, all 10 finalists are offered a one-month free stay in a Paris&Co incubator in 2018. Stay tuned for the results!
