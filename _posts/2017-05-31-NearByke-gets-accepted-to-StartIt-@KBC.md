[Start it @kbc](http://startit.be/) is Belgium's largest startup community consisting of early-stage startups, scale-ups, incubators, accelerators, mentors, VC's, and supporting and strategic partners (Accenture, Joyn, Cronos, Flanders DC, imec, KBC, Mobile Vikings, Telenet Kickstart and local knowledge institutions).
Thanks to this growing group of partners, Start it is able to offer mentoring, co-working spaces, a startup academy and lots of events.

While NearByke will mainly be based in Ghent, Start it also has hubs in Antwerp, Brussels, Leuven, Hasselt and Kortrijk, and is firmly committed to internationalization in both Europe and the United States.
