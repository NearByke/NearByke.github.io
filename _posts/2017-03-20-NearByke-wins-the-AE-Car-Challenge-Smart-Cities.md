The AE Car Challenge is a competition organized by [AE - Architects for business & ICT](https://www.ae.be/en/ae-architects-for-business-ict). 
This edition, the goal was to present an innovative idea in the theme of Smart Cities.
During the run-up towards the final pitch, the teams were offered workshops and professional help from consultants to work out the ideation phase of their project.

At the final event, each team had the opportunity to pitch for a jury of professionals and field experts. 
Nearbyke was elected as winner and went home with the first prize, 4 months in a BMW cabrio.
This sure might come in handy while they develop their project even further.
